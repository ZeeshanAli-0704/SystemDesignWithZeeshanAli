Got it 👍 You want me to break this **one long article on Load Balancers** into **3 parts**, each with its own **Table of Contents, theory, examples, practical usage, and detailed flow** — so it reads like a mini-series.

Here’s a proposed **3-part structure** for you:

---

# **Part 1: Introduction to Load Balancing**

### Table of Contents

1. [What is a Load Balancer?](#what-is-a-load-balancer)
2. [Why Use a Load Balancer?](#why-use-a-load-balancer)

   * [Increased Availability and Reliability](#increased-availability-and-reliability)
   * [Improved Performance](#improved-performance)
   * [Scalability](#scalability)
   * [Maintenance](#maintenance)
3. [What Does Load Balancing Actually Do?](#what-does-load-balancing-actually-do)
4. [Layer 4 vs. Layer 7 Load Balancing](#layer-4-vs-layer-7-load-balancing)
5. [Real-World Examples of Load Balancers](#real-world-examples-of-load-balancers)
6. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

✅ **Content Flow:**

* **Theory:** Define load balancer and purpose in distributed systems.
* **Practical Use:** Show how Amazon, Netflix, or banking apps rely on load balancers.
* **Example:** Simple web-app with 3 servers being balanced.
* **Deep Dive:** Explain Layer 4 vs. Layer 7 with diagrams.

# **Part 2: Types of Load Balancers**

### Table of Contents

1. [Types of Load Balancers](#types-of-load-balancers)

   * [Hardware Load Balancers](#hardware-load-balancers)
   * [Software Load Balancers](#software-load-balancers)
   * [Cloud-based Load Balancers](#cloud-based-load-balancers)
2. [Case Studies and Use Cases](#case-studies-and-use-cases)

   * [Enterprises Using Hardware LB](#enterprises-using-hardware-lb)

   * [Modern Apps Using Cloud LB](#modern-apps-using-cloud-lb)
3. [Challenges and Trade-offs](#challenges-and-trade-offs)
4. [Choosing the Right Type](#choosing-the-right-type)
5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

✅ **Content Flow:**

* **Theory:** Explain hardware, software, cloud-based load balancers.
* **Practical Use:** Compare **F5 BIG-IP (hardware)**, **NGINX / HAProxy (software)**, **AWS ELB / Azure LB (cloud)**.
* **Examples:** When to choose hardware for banks, software for e-commerce, cloud for SaaS startups.
* **Decision Framework:** Cost, scalability, flexibility.

# **Part 3: Load Balancing Algorithms and Advanced Usage**

### Table of Contents

1. [Load Balancing Algorithms](#load-balancing-algorithms)

   * [Round Robin](#round-robin)
   * [Least Connections](#least-connections)
   * [Weighted Round Robin](#weighted-round-robin)
   * [Weighted Least Connections](#weighted-least-connections)
   * [IP Hash](#ip-hash)
   * [Least Response Time](#least-response-time)
2. [Sticky Sessions in Load Balancing](#sticky-sessions-in-load-balancing)
3. [Q\&A: Load Balancing in System Design Interviews](#qa-load-balancing-in-system-design-interviews)
4. [Choosing the Right Load Balancing Product](#choosing-the-right-load-balancing-product)

   * [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](#application-load-balancer-alb)
   * [Proxy Network Load Balancer (NLB)](#proxy-network-load-balancer-nlb)
   * [Passthrough Network Load Balancer (NLB)](#passthrough-network-load-balancer-nlb)
5. [Load Balancing for Internal Traffic](#load-balancing-for-internal-traffic)
6. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

✅ **Content Flow:**

* **Theory:** Explain each algorithm in depth.
* **Practical Use:** Real cases — e.g., banking app uses **Least Connections**, gaming uses **IP Hash**, SaaS uses **Weighted Round Robin**.
* **System Design Interview Prep:** FAQs like “Layer 4 vs Layer 7” and “When to use sticky sessions”.
* **Examples:** Show a **3-tier application** with internal + external load balancers.
* **Conclusion:** Tie together algorithm + type + product choice.

👉 Each part will feel **self-contained**, but together they form a **complete series on Load Balancing**.

Do you want me to **start drafting Part 1 (full rewritten article with details, examples, and diagrams references)** now, and then move to Part 2 and Part 3 one by one?
