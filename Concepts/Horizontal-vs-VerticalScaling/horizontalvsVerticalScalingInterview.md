## Introduction

**Scaling** is about increasing a system’s capacity to handle load—more users, more data, more requests—without breaking reliability or blowing up cost. You have two primary levers:

* **Vertical scaling (scale‑up):** Make a single machine bigger/faster.
* **Horizontal scaling (scale‑out):** Add more machines and distribute work.

Most real systems do **both** over time: scale up early for simplicity, then scale out for sustained growth and resilience.

---

## Comparison / Trade-offs

### Which is easier to implement and why?

**Vertical is easier**. You upgrade CPU, memory, disk, or instance size. No code changes, minimal architecture churn.

**But**: you inherit a **single point of failure (SPOF)** and a **hard ceiling** (the biggest box you can buy/afford). Costs rise non‑linearly at the high end.

> **Interview line:** *“Scale up is the fastest bandaid; scale out is the durable fix.”*

### Limitations of vertical scaling

* **Hardware ceiling:** Limited by max CPU sockets, RAM capacity, memory bandwidth, and storage IOPS.
* **SPOF:** One box, one failure domain. If it dies, you’re down.
* **Diminishing returns:** Amdahl’s Law—some parts won’t speed up by adding cores.
* **Upgrade blast radius:** Upgrades can cause downtime or risky live resizes.
* **Cost curve:** High‑end hardware is disproportionately expensive.

### Why large-scale systems prefer horizontal scaling

* **Elasticity:** Add/remove nodes to match demand.
* **Fault isolation:** Fail one node, others keep serving.
* **Throughput & locality:** Parallelize work, push compute closer to data/users.
* **Economics:** Commodity hardware + pay‑as‑you‑go beats monolithic super‑servers.
* **Multi‑AZ/region:** Survive data center failures and improve latency.

## Deep Dive / Architecture

### Scaling a relational database: vertical vs horizontal

**Vertical (scale‑up):**

* Bigger instance (more vCPU/RAM), faster NVMe, larger buffer pool.
* Tune: connection pooling, query plans, proper indexes, memory settings.
* Pros: Simple, transactional semantics preserved, minimal app changes.
* Cons: Ceiling, SPOF, expensive.

**Horizontal (scale‑out):**

* **Read replicas:** Offload reads; app does read/write splitting.
* **Partitioning/Sharding:** Split data across shards by key (e.g., user\_id, tenant\_id, order\_id range).

  * **Hash sharding:** Even distribution; harder range queries.
  * **Range sharding:** Good for time series/ranges; watch for hot shards.
  * **Directory/lookup sharding:** Indirect mapping; flexible but adds a hop.
* **Multi‑primary (write scaling):** Requires conflict resolution or partitioned ownership.
* **Federation/CQRS:** Write to OLTP store; project to read models/materialized views for scale.

**Migration sketch:**

1. Add replicas → route safe reads. 2) Introduce a shard key at write path. 3) Backfill + dual‑write. 4) Cut traffic shard‑by‑shard. 5) Decommission monolith.

> **Interview line:** *“Start with replicas, then shard by a stable, high‑cardinality key; plan re‑sharding from day one.”*

### How horizontal scaling impacts consistency (CAP & PACELC)

* **CAP:** In the presence of partitions (P), you trade **Consistency (C)** vs **Availability (A)**. Horizontal systems must tolerate P → many choose availability with **eventual consistency** (AP). Others choose CP (strong consistency) and accept unavailability during partitions.
* **PACELC:** *If Partition (P) happens → trade A vs C; **Else** (no partition) trade **Latency (L)** vs **Consistency (C)**.* Even without failures, cross‑node coordination adds latency for strong consistency.
* **Read models:**

  * **Strong:** Linearizable reads/writes (single leader, quorum).
  * **Eventual:** Replicas converge over time (read‑after‑write may be stale).
  * **Tunable:** Quorums (R+W>N) for “strong‑enough”.
* **Client patterns:** read‑your‑writes, monotonic reads, session consistency.

> **Interview line:** *“Horizontal scale introduces replica lag; we often relax to eventual consistency or use quorums to balance latency and correctness.”*

### Infrastructure you need for horizontal scaling

* **Load balancer (L4/L7):** Health checks, weighted routing, sticky sessions when necessary.
* **Distributed caching:** Redis/Memcached (clustered), cache key discipline, eviction/TTL, stampede protection.
* **Distributed storage:**

  * **Relational** with replicas/shards;
  * **NoSQL** (Cassandra/Dynamo) for partitioned, high‑throughput;
  * **Object storage** (S3/GCS) for blobs;
  * **Distributed FS** for shared files where needed.
* **Service discovery & config:** DNS, Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes DNS; config/coordination via etcd/ZooKeeper.
* **Orchestration & autoscaling:** Kubernetes, ASGs; HPA/VPA and Cluster Autoscaler.
* **Observability:** Metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry), logs (ELK/Loki). SLOs, alerts, dashboards.
* **Networking:** VPC design, pod/service CIDRs, egress/ingress, rate limiting, WAF, API gateway.
* **Reliability controls:** Circuit breakers, retries with jitter, timeouts, bulkheads, backpressure.
* **Delivery & infra as code:** CI/CD, blue‑green/canary, Terraform/Pulumi, secrets management.

### What role does caching play in scaling?

* **Primary lever for read scale & latency:** Serve hot data from RAM at micro‑ to millisecond speed.
* **Where to cache:**

  * **Client/browser**; **CDN/edge** (static & edge compute); **app tier** (Redis); **DB/materialized views**.
* **Patterns:** cache‑aside (lazy), write‑through, write‑back, refresh‑ahead.
* **Keys & invalidation:** Namespacing, versioning, TTLs, event‑driven invalidation; protect against stampedes (request coalescing, mutex, jittered TTLs).
* **Consistency:** Decide tolerance for staleness; support read‑after‑write where necessary (e.g., bypass or short TTL on user‑profile updates).

> **Interview line:** *“Cache first; it’s the cheapest scale. Then scale out storage/compute.”*

## Failure Handling / Availability

### SPOF vs fault tolerance

* **Vertical scale** concentrates risk: single machine, single AZ, single NIC/volume.
* **Horizontal scale** spreads risk: N replicas, multi‑AZ/region, rolling upgrades.
* **Design for failure:** graceful degradation, brownouts, traffic shedding, overload protection.

### Read-heavy vs write-heavy: choosing a strategy

**Read‑heavy:** replicas + caches + denormalized read models.
**Write‑heavy:** sharding/partition ownership, log‑structured stores, batching/queues, idempotent writes, hot‑key mitigation (random suffixing, consistent hashing, time‑bucketed IDs).

> **Interview line:** *“Reads scale with replicas; writes scale with ownership (shards).”*

---

## Scenario Playbooks

### Slow web app: vertical or horizontal?

1. **Measure first:** CPU, memory, GC, heap, disk IOPS, DB QPS/latency, queue depth, p95/p99, error rates, RPS.
2. **If host‑bound:** scale up (bigger instance, faster disk) + fix hot paths.
3. **If throughput‑bound:** scale out (LB + more app pods/instances).
4. **Always:** add caching, index queries, async offload, connection pooling.
5. **Guardrails:** timeouts, retries with jitter, circuit breakers to avoid cascades.

> **Interview line:** *“Diagnose before dollars; cache before clusters.”*

### Stateless vs stateful: how to scale horizontally

**Stateless services**

* Store **no user/session state** in memory beyond a request.
* Scale by simply adding nodes; LB can send any request to any node.
* Externalize state to Redis/DB; use idempotent handlers.

**Stateful services**

* Options: **sticky sessions**, **external session store**, or **partitioned ownership** (e.g., user‑ID‑based ownership).
* For consensus‑bound state (leaders, locks), use **Raft/Zab** systems (etcd/ZooKeeper) and expect lower write throughput.
* For collaborative/near‑real‑time (docs/chat), consider **CRDTs** for AP trade‑offs.

### When AWS/RDS hits vertical limits

* **Exploit replicas** for reads; use a **read‑write proxy** to split traffic.
* **Shard** by tenant, region, or entity (user/order). Precompute **routing** (lookup table/consistent hashing).
* **Denormalize** hot paths to reduce cross‑shard joins; use **CQRS** + events to project read models.
* **Add cache layers** (Redis) and **materialized views** for expensive reads.
* **Archive cold data** and compress; narrow indexes; tune autovacuums.
* **Zero‑downtime plan:** dual writes + backfill → switch reads → cut writes shard‑by‑shard.

> **Interview line:** *“RDS scale‑up buys time; sharding is the destination. Plan re‑shardability on day one.”*

### Scaling an e‑commerce checkout service

* **Requirements:** high availability, idempotency, exactly‑once‑ish payment capture, inventory integrity.
* **Topology:**

  * Multiple **checkout service** instances behind LB.
  * **External session/cart store** (Redis/DynamoDB).
  * **Order DB** partitioned by customer/region/order\_id.
  * **Payment worker** consuming from a **queue** (SQS/Kafka) with retry & dead‑letter.
  * **Inventory service** with reservation (hold → confirm → release on timeout).
  * **Idempotency keys** on APIs; dedupe table with TTL.
* **Consistency:** prefer **sagas** over 2PC. Design compensating actions (refund, restock).
* **Resilience:** circuit breakers to PSPs, fallback to alternate gateways, poison‑pill handling.
* **Observability:** trace an order end‑to‑end (distributed tracing). Auditable logs.

> **Interview line:** *“Scale nodes, externalize cart state, partition orders, queue payments, and enforce idempotency throughout.”*

### How Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling

* **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):** scales pods based on CPU/memory/custom/external metrics (v2). Set min/max replicas and stabilization windows.
* **Cluster Autoscaler:** adds/removes nodes to fit pending pods.
* **Service & Ingress:** built‑in L4/L7 load distribution. Readiness/liveness probes for safe rollout.
* **StatefulSets + PVCs:** stable identities, ordered updates for stateful workloads.
* **Best practices:** pod anti‑affinity (spread across AZs), PDBs, resource requests/limits, autoscaling cooldowns, and **slow start** to avoid thundering herds.

> **Interview line:** *“HPA scales pods, Cluster Autoscaler scales nodes, and readiness gates keep traffic on healthy replicas.”*
