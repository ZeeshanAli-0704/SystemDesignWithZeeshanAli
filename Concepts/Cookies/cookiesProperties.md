# üç™ The Ultimate Guide to Cookie Properties in the Browser

Cookies are the backbone of **state management on the web**. They help websites remember who you are, what‚Äôs in your shopping cart, or what theme you prefer. But beyond the basics of `document.cookie`, cookies have **many properties** that control their **scope, security, and behavior across domains**.

This blog is a **deep dive into cookie properties** ‚Äî from `Expires` to `SameSite` and **how cross-origin rules affect them**.

## üîπ Introduction

A cookie is a small **key-value pair** stored in the browser. While the basics are simple (`name=value`), the true power of cookies lies in their **properties**. These properties control **lifetime, accessibility, domain scope, cross-site rules, and security**.

---

## üîπ Basic Structure of a Cookie

Cookies are set using the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header:

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2027 22:23:01 GMT; Path=/; Domain=example.com; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict;
```

Here:

* `sessionId=abc123` ‚Üí Name & value
* `Expires` ‚Üí Expiration date
* `Path=/` ‚Üí Cookie available across entire domain
* `Domain=example.com` ‚Üí Scoped to this domain
* `Secure` ‚Üí Sent only via HTTPS
* `HttpOnly` ‚Üí Not accessible from JavaScript
* `SameSite=Strict` ‚Üí Prevents cross-site usage

---

## üîπ Cookie Properties Explained

### 1. **Name=Value**

* The fundamental unit of a cookie.
* Name must be unique within its scope (domain + path).

Example:

```http
Set-Cookie: username=Zeeshan
```

---

### 2. **Expires & Max-Age**

* **Expires**: A fixed date/time after which the cookie is invalid.
* **Max-Age**: Lifetime in seconds (takes precedence over Expires).

Examples:

```http
Set-Cookie: theme=dark; Expires=Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT
Set-Cookie: token=xyz; Max-Age=3600
```

‚ö° Session cookies are created if neither `Expires` nor `Max-Age` is set (deleted when browser closes).

---

### 3. **Domain**

* Controls which **hosts** can receive the cookie.
* By default, cookies are scoped to the **exact domain** that set them.
* If specified, subdomains can also access it.

Example:

```http
Set-Cookie: userId=123; Domain=example.com
```

* Accessible to `www.example.com`, `shop.example.com`.
* Not accessible to `evil.com`.

‚ùå **Security risk**: Overly broad domain cookies (like `.com`) are rejected by browsers.

---

### 4. **Path**

* Restricts cookie to specific paths.

Example:

```http
Set-Cookie: cart=5; Path=/shop
```

* Sent with requests to `/shop` or `/shop/products`.
* Not sent to `/profile`.

---

### 5. **Secure**

* Cookie only sent over **HTTPS**.
* Prevents exposure on unencrypted connections.

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc; Secure
```

---

### 6. **HttpOnly**

* Cookie is **inaccessible to JavaScript** (`document.cookie`).
* Helps prevent **XSS attacks** from stealing cookies.

```http
Set-Cookie: auth=abc; HttpOnly
```

---

### 7. **SameSite**

Controls whether cookies are sent with **cross-site requests**.

* `Strict`: Sent only for same-site navigation. Strongest CSRF protection.
* `Lax`: Sent for top-level navigations (safe by default).
* `None`: Sent for all requests, must be `Secure`.

Example:

```http
Set-Cookie: csrftoken=xyz; SameSite=Strict
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Modern browsers **default to `SameSite=Lax`** if not specified.

---

### 8. **Priority** (Chrome-specific)

Determines eviction order when hitting browser cookie limits:

* `Low`, `Medium`, `High`.

```http
Set-Cookie: pref=light; Priority=High
```

---

### 9. **Partitioned Cookies (CHIPS)**

A new spec: **Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS)**.

* Each third-party cookie is **isolated per top-level site**.
* Improves privacy by preventing tracking across sites.

```http
Set-Cookie: id=123; Secure; SameSite=None; Partitioned
```

---

## üîπ Cookies and Cross-Origin Rules

### 1. **First-Party vs Third-Party Cookies**

* **First-party cookies**: Set by the site you are visiting.
* **Third-party cookies**: Set by external domains (e.g., ad networks).
* Browsers are phasing out **third-party cookies** due to privacy concerns.

---

### 2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) & SameSite**

* Without `SameSite`, attackers can force a victim‚Äôs browser to send cookies to your site via a malicious request.
* `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax` mitigates this.

---

### 3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with Cookies**

When making cross-origin AJAX requests:

* Server must allow credentials with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
* Browser must send cookies with `fetch(..., { credentials: "include" })`.

Example:

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  credentials: "include"
});
```

Server response must include:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

---

## üîπ Real-World Examples

1. **Authentication** ‚Üí Secure + HttpOnly session tokens.
2. **E-commerce** ‚Üí Shopping cart with `Path=/cart`.
3. **Multi-subdomain apps** ‚Üí `Domain=example.com` for SSO.
4. **Analytics** ‚Üí Third-party cookies (phasing out ‚Üí CHIPS).

---

## üîπ Best Practices

‚úÖ Use `Secure` + `HttpOnly` for auth cookies.
‚úÖ Use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` to mitigate CSRF.
‚úÖ Avoid overly broad `Domain` values.
‚úÖ Keep cookies small (<4KB).
‚úÖ Prefer server-set cookies over client-side JS.
‚úÖ For cross-origin APIs, configure **CORS properly**.

---

## üîπ Conclusion

Cookies may seem simple, but **their properties define how they behave in terms of security, scope, and cross-origin interactions**. By mastering these attributes ‚Äî especially `SameSite`, `Secure`, and `HttpOnly` ‚Äî you can **secure your apps, prevent attacks, and ensure a smooth user experience**.

The future is moving towards **privacy-first cookies** (CHIPS, partitioned cookies), so understanding these fundamentals is more important than ever.
