Matering Design Pattern

Design patterns are well approved solution of commonly occuring problems in software design

Types of design Pattern
- creational design pattern
 (related to object creation & usage)
- Structural design pattern (code structure, object, class etc)
- Behavioural Design pattern ( how code interacts .. like how objects will interact with each other)


SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN

Create object only once & use multiple places

example 
for JDBC- we create single instance of DB instance to perform all crud operations

Singleton
create private constructor

create static method of that class in that class (so that same methos of this class can be called with object as this is static)

create a object with the help of method.

Add a java code to

1 Create simple singleton class & usage - condider both lazy & eager approach

2) now consider multithread & explain how can we stop it



Factory Design Pattern
