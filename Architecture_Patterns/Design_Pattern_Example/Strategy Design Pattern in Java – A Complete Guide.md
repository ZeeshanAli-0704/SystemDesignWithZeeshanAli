> ‚ÄúDesign patterns are solutions to recurring problems in software design. Think of them as time-tested blueprints.‚Äù

In this post, we‚Äôll demystify the **Strategy Design Pattern**, walk through a real-world use case, and build a clean Java implementation. If you‚Äôre preparing for LLD interviews, learning design patterns, or aiming to write flexible and maintainable code, this one‚Äôs for you.

## ‚úÖ What is the Strategy Design Pattern?

The **Strategy Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that enables you to define a **family of algorithms**, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The key idea is to **delegate the behavior to different strategy classes** instead of hardcoding it.

> üîÅ Strategy pattern is all about **choosing behavior at runtime**.

---

## üß† Real Life Analogy

Think about a **navigation app** like Google Maps.

* You want to go from Point A to Point B.
* Based on conditions (fastest, least traffic, shortest), the **route strategy** changes.
* The app uses a **strategy (algorithm)** to calculate the best route.

These strategies are:

* üõ£Ô∏è Fastest Route
* üöó Shortest Distance
* üß≠ Avoid Tolls

At runtime, the user picks the strategy.

---

## üìå When to Use Strategy Pattern

Use the Strategy pattern when:

* You have multiple algorithms for a specific task.
* You want to switch between algorithms at runtime.
* You want to reduce conditionals (`if-else` or `switch`).
* You want to follow the **Open/Closed Principle** (OCP) ‚Äì Open for extension, closed for modification.

## üí¨ Example Problem Statement

> üßæ Design a payment system where a user can pay using **different payment methods** ‚Äî Credit Card, UPI, and PayPal. The system should allow selecting or switching payment strategy **dynamically at runtime**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step by Step Java Implementation

Let‚Äôs implement this in Java using the Strategy Design Pattern.

---

### Step 1: Create the Strategy Interface

```java
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

---

### Step 2: Implement Different Strategies

```java
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String cardNumber;

    public CreditCardPayment(String cardNumber) {
        this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ‚Çπ" + amount + " using Credit Card: " + cardNumber);
    }
}
```

```java
public class UpiPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String upiId;

    public UpiPayment(String upiId) {
        this.upiId = upiId;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ‚Çπ" + amount + " using UPI: " + upiId);
    }
}
```

```java
public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String email;

    public PayPalPayment(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ‚Çπ" + amount + " using PayPal: " + email);
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Create the Context Class

```java
public class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    // Allow strategy to be set at runtime
    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void payAmount(double amount) {
        if (strategy == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Payment strategy not set.");
        }
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Use in Main Class

```java
public class StrategyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentContext context = new PaymentContext();

        // Using Credit Card
        context.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment("1234-5678-9012-3456"));
        context.payAmount(1500);

        // Switching to UPI
        context.setPaymentStrategy(new UpiPayment("zeeshan@upi"));
        context.payAmount(800);

        // Switching to PayPal
        context.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment("zeeshan@gmail.com"));
        context.payAmount(2000);
    }
}
```

## üåü Benefits of Strategy Pattern

| Benefit                  | Description                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle  | Add new strategies without modifying existing code |
| ‚úÖ Flexibility            | Choose behavior at runtime                         |
| ‚úÖ Eliminate Conditionals | Replaces large if-else/switch blocks               |
| ‚úÖ Reusability            | Each strategy is a reusable, independent class     |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

* **Too many small classes** if overused.
* **Wrong abstraction** can lead to complexity.
* **Forgetting default/null strategies** can cause runtime issues.

---

## ‚úÖ Real-World Use Cases

* Payment Gateways
* Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Comparator)
* Compression (ZIP, RAR, GZIP)
* Authentication Strategies (OAuth, JWT, LDAP)
* Route finding in GPS apps

---

## üîö Conclusion

The **Strategy Pattern** is a powerful way to inject flexibility into your application by **decoupling algorithms from the context** where they‚Äôre used. It's an essential tool in your **LLD (Low-Level Design)** toolkit, especially for interview prep and scalable production systems.
